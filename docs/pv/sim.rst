Simulated Values
----------------

Locally generated simulation data. Mainly useful during testing, or in combination with other PVs using formulas. Full documentation is upcoming. For now please have a look at the example operator displays in the YSS projects.

Example PV Names:

* ``sim://ramp(0,1,1,0.5)``
* ``sim://const(4)``
* ``sim://noise``
* ``sim://sine``
