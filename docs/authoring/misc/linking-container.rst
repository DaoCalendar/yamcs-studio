Displays can include other displays, or groups of other displays. This is particularly useful to avoid duplication when creating shared components, such as top bars or side bars.

Define the included OPI file with the **OPI File** property, then optionally define the group with the **Group Name** property. If you don't specify a group the entire display is embedded. Tweak properties such as the **Resize Behaviour** to get your desired outcome.
