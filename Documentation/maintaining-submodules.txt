This project includes some external CS-Studio submodules to
make it easier to integrate documentation and write scripts
that work on everyone's setup.

You should read up on gitmodules if you plan on using its
functionality, or if you want to try out some changes
to the source-code contained therein.

All of the current CS-Studio repositories have their
commit ID pointing to a recent commit on their master
branch. I tried using the 4.0.x branch everywhere but
that crashed on multiple locations in fresh installs.

From time to time these commit-references should be
fast-forwarded by the maintainer of Yamcs-Studio.
(The shared configuration for git submodules cannot
follow a branch, only an exact commit).

Be careful not to push commits with commit-references
that exist only locally in your workspace (this was
one of the reasons not to pursue using the 4.0.x
branch, as we'd have to fork the stuff to a shared
location).
