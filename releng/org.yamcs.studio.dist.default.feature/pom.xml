  <description>
    This feature contains only the product plugin
    for the default open-source Yamcs Studio distribution.
    We need this maven artefact, so that we can add it as
    an included feature to the *.product file.
    
    Do NOT combine this into the core feature, because we
    want the core feature to be easily reusable WITHOUT
    including the product configuration. This has two
    advantages:
    - easier to include core feature branding in derived products
    - the default product plugin could crash a derived product if
      it also attempts to define this.
